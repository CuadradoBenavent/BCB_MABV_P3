Within this folder there are the following documents:

- AUTHORS file containing the names of all contributors.

- dynamics.pdf file containing the instructions followed to peform this homework.

- energies.dat file containing the different energies computed after executing the code for the inp.txt file.

- inp.txt file as an example of an input conatining 3 Ar atoms.

- INSTALL.md file containing instructions on how to compile and run the program.

- LICENSE file specifying the license for the code, in this case a GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. 

- MAKEFILE file used to compile and execute the molecular dynamics code, extract the trajectories and energies every 10 steps.

- md_simulation.c code written in C to run molecular dynamics. 

- md_simulation.exe file generated after compiling md_simulation.c, to be executed.

- README.md - this file containing information.

- tests directory containing different inputs for different number of Argon atoms and their initial trajectories. Included also their outputs.

- trajectory.xyz file containing the computed geometries and energies every 10 steps, to be visualized.
